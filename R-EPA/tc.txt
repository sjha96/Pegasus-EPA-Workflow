# This is the transformation catalog. It lists information about each of the
# executables that are used by the workflow.
#
# Here is an example:
#
#tr myexe {
#    site compute {
#        pfn "/usr/bin/myexe"
#        arch "x86_64"
#        os "LINUX"
#        type "INSTALLED"
#    }
#}
#

# These are the executables that the workflow uses. All the executables
# are stored on the local machine in this example.
